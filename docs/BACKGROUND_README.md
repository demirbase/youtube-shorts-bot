# Background Image Required

You need to add a file named `background.png` to this directory.

This image will be used as the static background for all generated videos.

## Recommendations:
- **Aspect Ratio**: 9:16 (vertical/portrait orientation for YouTube Shorts)
- **Resolution**: 1080x1920 pixels (ideal for YouTube Shorts)
- **Content**: Choose a simple, visually appealing background that doesn't distract from the subtitles
- **Format**: PNG (supports transparency) or JPG

## Where to find free background images:
- Unsplash (https://unsplash.com/)
- Pexels (https://www.pexels.com/)
- Pixabay (https://pixabay.com/)

## Example searches:
- "gradient background"
- "abstract background"
- "minimal background"
- "dark background"

**Important**: Make sure you have the right to use any image you choose, especially for commercial purposes if you plan to monetize.

Once you have your image, rename it to `background.png` and place it in this directory.
